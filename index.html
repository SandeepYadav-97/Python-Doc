            <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in
                the
                Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of
                exception
                handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989
            </p>
            <p>Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018,
                when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator
                For
                Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the
                project's chief decision-maker. He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering
                council. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry
                Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project. Guido
                van
                Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020 Steering counci</p>

            <header>Design and features</header>
            <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured
                programming
                are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented
                programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are
                supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming</p>
            <p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which
                includes
                aphorisms such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
                <li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
                <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
                <li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
                <li>Readability counts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly
                extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of
                adding
                programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with
                a
                large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC,
                which
                espoused the opposite approach.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Syntax_and_semantics">
            <header>Syntax and semantics</header>
            <p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it
                often
                uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does
                not
                use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if
                ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.</p>
            <h3>Indentation</h3>
            <p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An
                increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end
                of
                the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic
                structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but
                in
                most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four
                spaces.</p>

            <p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools
                suited
                to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME
                and
                HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to
                relational
                databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,
                manipulating
                regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
            <p>Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway
                Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are
                specified
                by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard
                library is
                cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant
                implementations.

            <p>Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the
                TIOBE
                Programming Community Index where, as of February 2021, it is the third most popular language
                (behind
                Java, and C). It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for "the highest rise in ratings in
                a
                year") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times)</p>
            <p>An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than
                conventional
                languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in
                a
                dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse
                than C
                or C++".</p>
            <p>Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon,
                Instagram, Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site
                Reddit
                was written mostly in Python.</p>
